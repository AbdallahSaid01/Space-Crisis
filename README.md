Gravity prototype controls:
'a' and 'd' or left and right arrows to move
'spacebar' to jump, number of jumps is locked to 2 until the collider of the character hits the ground
's' to slam down (fall faster)
mouse movement to move the gun around

parameters to edit for the LD:
Player's speed, jump force, slam down force.

Shooting:
-`Left mouse click` to fire a bullet
-While the bullet is midair, press `left shift` to teleport the player to the bullet's position
-You can `mouse scroll up` to activate the "Push Mode", where you infuse your bullet with horizontal gravitational push, pushing any enemies hit by the bullet
